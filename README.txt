LEADING EIGENVECTOR DYNAMICS ANALYSIS (LEiDA)

The LEiDA consists of computing instantaneous BOLD phase coherence matrices 
and clustering the corresponding leading eigenvectors into a set of 
patterns that can be visualized on the cortical surface or in matrix format.
  
This repository includes the codes and data to replicate the analysis
reported in my Licentiate's Degree Project titled "Research of Cognitive 
Decline Biomarkers in Healthy Elderly with Functional Magnetic Resonance Data".
